2020 Advent of Code - Python success stories
These are my 2020 Advent of Code scripts for completing the challenges

They aren't the prettiest as I'm moderate with Python, but the challenges are a lot of fun and my github account is pretty naked, so why not?

I was initially hesistant about posting these, but then my friend John Pavek (who is awesome.com) pointed out that there are already thousands of other folks posting theirs publicly.
